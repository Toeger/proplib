- prop::Container:
	- Templated class that can hold different types of objects
		- tuple
		- a known number of them (array)
		- an unknown number of them (vector)
		- other prop::Containers
	- Use CTAD to deduce types

- Possibly change prop::Polywrap to use std::unique_ptr instead of std::shared_ptr
