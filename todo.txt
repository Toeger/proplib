- prop::Container:
	- Templated class that can hold different types of objects
		- tuple
		- a known number of them (array)
		- an unknown number of them (vector)
		- other prop::Containers
	- Use CTAD to deduce types
	- Maybe not a good idea after all?
- Possibly change prop::Polywrap to use std::unique_ptr instead of std::shared_ptr
- Specialize prop::Property<volatile T> which does not store the value and instead fetches it every time
- Various Widget_loaders
	- Take ownership
	- Don't take ownership
	- Decide dynamically dependening on input type
